# UX

[1] Waifu Panel
	The waifu panel si the core of the game. The waifu panel should look like and function like every other dating sim out there. The waifu panel is covered in scanlines for aesthetic reasons
[2] Waifu
	The waifu remains center screen at all times. A high resolution pixel sprite set will be used (think, vaguely the resolution of a Va-11 Hall-a character sprite)
[3] Waifu Chat
	States teh dialouge given by the waifu
[4] Choices
	Options to respond to the prompt given by the waifu. There will always be two options no matter what. Even neutral diialouge will have two options (preferably two that canb eresponded to int he same way, like every old vis nov). There cannot be 3 options ever. Effects from the Tech Panel[5] May change the text within the choices. Not all choices branch narrative, some simply damage the Code Purity[8]. Very few options will deviate teh story, in order to save writting time.
[5] Tech Panel
	The tech panel displays the elements that can interact with the 'code' of the waifu. Visually similar to the Pip Boy from that one game todd howard made. Skyrim with guns.
[6] Tabs
	Tabs cycle through the different options of the tech panel. They are unlocked periodically through the story, typically given to you after dialouge with Trout[12]
[7] Active Tab
	The active tab takes up the majority of the room on the Tech Panel. Can be changed by clicking on tabs.
[8] Code Purity
	Code purity is the ehalth gauge for the game. It takes damage as poor decvisions or reckless tech are used. If code purity reaches zero the simulation collapses. The code purity meter has certain sweet spots , which allow bizarre methods of progression through the story (self aware AI, meta irony, beneficial 'errors)
[9] Bomb
	Classic game tool. Instantly clears any dialouge scenario. ifficult to accquire
[10] CPU %
	Measure the amount of CPU the simulation is taking. Certain techs increase the CPU usage. Having over 100% CPU causes continuous drain every tick[13]. Artificially oscilates similar to the phantom thieves percentages on the calendar/loading sections of Persona 5
[11] Comrade Console
	A screen that allows you to talk to the tutorial NPC, Comrade Trout[12]
[12] Comrade Trout
	The best friend character and tutorial NPC. Hes tyhere to ensure you successfully complete the simulation. Offers tutorial advice, his oppinion on certain decisions,a nd will opccasionally grant new techs
[13] Tick
	Only occurs after choices, or at specified moments of dialouge. This should mean that theres no worries about fast menu movement toa void penalties
